# Fourier Transformation

I made a manual fourier transform that will produce a graph from some wave that will have spikes at the x-values which can pruduce this wave as frequencies in a sum of sine waves (roughly). The amplitude of he spike reflects the amplitude fo the sine wave with that frequency, but there is not a linear relationship.
